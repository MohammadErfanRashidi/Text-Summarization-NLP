# Text-Summarization-NLP, with Sumy

This project demonstrates how to perform extractive text summarization using the Sumy library in Python. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Sumy
- NLTK

## Installation

1. Install the required libraries:

2. Download the 'punkt' resource for NLTK:

## Usage

1. Place your text file (e.g., "your_text_file.txt") in the same directory as the script.
2. Modify the file path in the code if necessary.
3. Run the script. The extractive summary will be printed to the console and saved to "summary.txt".

## Customization

- You can change the summarization algorithm by replacing `LsaSummarizer` with other options like `LuhnSummarizer` or `LexRankSummarizer`.
- Adjust the `sentences_count` parameter to control the length of the summary.
